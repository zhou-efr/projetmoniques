## development mode
Run `npm install` within the project folder. <br/><br/>
Then run the react-native development server with `npx react-native start` (`npm start` also often work).<br/><br/>
To install the development app on your mobile run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios`, if need specify the target device with the flag `--deviceId` on android and `--simulator` on ios.<br/><br/>
Once the app is installed it isn't needed to install it again each time, just launch the development server and connect both of yours devices on the same network. If you add some assets or dependencies you'll may have to reinstall the app.
